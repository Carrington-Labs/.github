# Pioneer Capitol Strategies

## Overview
Pioneer Capitol Strategies is a forward-thinking academy on a mission to evolve into a fully-fledged hedge fund. We are currently operating a Discord server that features a web scraping bot designed to retrieve trading data from the US Congress. Our aim is to leverage this data to generate profitable investment opportunities for our subscribers.

## Mission
Our mission is to utilize advanced data analytics and strategic investment insights to empower our subscribers with unique trading opportunities. By tracking the trading activities of the US Congress, we aim to mirror these trades, thereby providing our investors with the potential for significant returns.

## Current Operations
- **Discord Server**: Our active community on Discord serves as a hub for our members to discuss trading strategies, share insights, and stay updated with the latest market trends.
- **Web Scraping Bot**: This bot automatically collects and updates trading data from the US Congress, providing our community with real-time insights.

## Future Plans
1. **Forming an Axiebolag (Swedish LLC)**:
   - **Subscription Model**: We plan to offer a subscription service with flexible payment options (monthly, quarterly, or custom plans).
   - **Investment Strategy**: Subscriber funds will be used to buy and sell the same shares as the US Congress.
   - **Earnings Distribution**: Investors will receive their earnings on a yearly basis after each sale.
  #### How It Would Work:
  - **Subscription**: Choose a subscription plan that fits your investment goals and budget.
  - **Investment**: Your subscription funds are pooled together and used to execute trades based on the data collected from US Congress trading activities.
  - **Returns**: Profits from these trades are distributed to subscribers annually, providing a potential for substantial returns.

2. **Becoming a Luxembourger Hedge Fund**:
   - **Long-Term Vision**: Our ultimate goal is to transition into a Luxembourg-based hedge fund, expanding our investment strategies and operations to a global scale.
