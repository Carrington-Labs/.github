## 🧠 About Us

> We don’t build startups.  
> We build blackbox-grade tools for devs, hackers, sysadmins, and the quietly elite.

Carrington Labs is where ideas go from sketch to ship.  
We focus on **performance**, **minimalism**, and **absolute control** over the stack.  
You won’t find bloat here. Just clean, purpose-built systems designed to **handle edge cases like it’s the default**.

## 🧬 Philosophy

> You don’t need 20 MB of JavaScript to do one job.

At Carrington Labs:
- We **ship less code** to get more done.  
- We **build tools** that never panic on error.  
- We **respect the stack** — from silicon to UX.  
- And we don’t use frameworks as crutches.

> "Software should serve the builder, not resist them."
